## Bio

### Summary

- Archaeologist
- Bookworm
- Always wears his stupid hat
- He ventured too deep during an expedition. He was trapped and experiencing nightmare upon nightmare until he agreed to serve the Cthonian God
- Not totally sane
- Afraid of sleeping

### Background

## Future planning

- Return to Kapuel
- Rejoin the college and finish his wizardry studies
- "Find" High Elven Mage trainer/mentor
- Become a wizard at level 10
- Become a High Elven Mage at level 11

### Ways to bypass the "100" years of training problem

- Study in a place where the time flows differently than Fenru
  - Eternal Citadel
  - Feywild
  - Demiplane
- Time travel
  - Study normally and time travel back to current events (has a lot of problems)
  - Travel back in time and spent the "long way around" studying up until current events (preferable)

#### Story Ideas

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party keeps investigating the disappearance of the dragons (or the imprisonment of a very specific one). Nasir wants to learn more about the historic events. They meet a hooded figure that works as an exposition dump. Nasir still pushing for more info and the robbed figure suggest to him to look through the "time vortex" that the figure "opens". Nasir looks into the vortex mesmerized (other players can look as well and the GM can give them any kind of vision appropriate for those characters). Nasir wanting to learn even more leans toward the vortex and touches the ripples of space-time continuum, creating a fixed point in time. He is pulled through the vortex and dropped right in front of the events that lead to the departure-of-the-dragons/imprisonment-of-a-specific-dragon x00 years into the past. His sudden appearance disturbs the High Elven Magic Ritual that is taking place, and his participation, and lifeforce, are now required for the successful completion of the ritual. After the ritual is completed, Nasir explains that he is a person out of time and all the mages present agree that it is too dangerous for him continue free, since his actions are very likely to change the route of time. He is taken to Greenbrier Glade, where he will live in seclusion until the "time is right" again. He is not allowed to interact with the outside world, not even learning the contemporary news. He is only allowed to study events already in the past from the point he arrived. He was also allowed to continue his studies as a wizard. During the his eon-long seclusion, his guardians saw a potential in him and started teaching him the ancient practices of the elves. After all he had x00 in front of him. When finally the "time was right", he was allowed to travel back to {PLACE_OF_DEPARTURE} and make sure that time is not corrupted.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meanwhile, back in {TIME_AND_PLACE_OF_DEPARTURE}, just after Nasir went through the time vortex, the robbed figure waves its hand and closes the timegate again, before the rest of the party get a chance to react. He then pulls down his hood and reveals being, a much older, Nasir.
